**NOTE**: The documentation below refers to an unreleased version of kuby-sidekiq.

## kuby-sidekiq

Sidekiq plugin for [Kuby](https://github.com/getkuby/kuby-core).

## Intro

The Sidekiq plugin that makes it easy to run a deployment of Sidekiq workers for your Rails app. Behind the scenes it uses [kuby-redis](https://github.com/getkuby/kuby-redis) to stand up an instance of Redis and Kubernetes deployments to start the desired number of workers.

## Configuration

Add the kuby-sidekiq and [sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq) gems to your Gemfile and run `bundle install`.

Require the plugin in your kuby.rb file and configure it, eg:

```ruby
require 'kuby/sidekiq'

Kuby.define(:production) do
  kubernetes do

    add_plugin(:sidekiq) do
      replicas 2  # run two workers
    end

  end
end
```

Next, run the setup command, eg:

```bash
bundle exec kuby -e production setup
```

## Connecting to Redis

Add a Sidekiq initializer to your Rails app and tell Sidekiq how to connect to Redis:

```ruby
# config/initializers/sidekiq.rb

if Rails.env.production?
  require 'kuby'

  Kuby.load!

  Sidekiq.configure_server do |config|
    config.redis = Kuby.environment.kubernetes.plugin(:sidekiq).connection_params
  end

  Sidekiq.configure_client do |config|
    config.redis = Kuby.environment.kubernetes.plugin(:sidekiq).connection_params
  end
end
```

### Build and Deploy

Now that Sidekiq has been installed and configured, build, push, and deploy your app the usual way, eg:

```bash
bundle exec kuby -e production build
bundle exec kuby -e production push
bundle exec kuby -e production deploy
```
